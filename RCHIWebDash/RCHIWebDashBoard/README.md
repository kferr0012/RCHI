- currently moving from bootstrap to semantic ui.
- Semantic UI has more useful tools for creating the dashboards, and is more flexible in my opinion(Josiah)
- Some of the older dashboards relied on bootstrap and are therefore have had their formats messed up
    - Though the older dashboards arent useful and display nothing, I am going to hold of on deleting them
    - I have removed the links to them in the header
